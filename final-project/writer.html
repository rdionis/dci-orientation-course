            <p>As one of my creative writing teachers once told me, "next time someone asks you what you do, tell them you're a writer". And so I do.</p>

            <p>My relationship with writing began with journaling at the very young age of six, which was when I first learnt how to write. I'd put on paper everything that happened, my feelings and emotions, how unfair it was that my parents wouldn't buy me that you I really wanted... You know, a "dear diary" type of thing. Inspired by Anne Frank's writing, I later decided to name my diary too, and I would change the name whenever I started a new book. I only remember two of those names: Teddy (I'm guessing because I was inseparable from this tiny teddy bear I carried everywhere until the tragic morning I left it in bed when it was laundry at the hotel me and my parents were staying in) and Freddy (no idea why).</p>
            
            <p>And so when I went to University I decided to study Journalism. Creative writing was not a thing back then and this seemed like the best next thing.</p>
            
            <p>I didn't hate being a journalist, but my writing just needed another direction. So I started writing <a href="https://hellopoetry.com/bailaraq/poems/" target="_blank">poems</a>, which I now perform occasionally at spoken word events around Berlin. Recently, I created an online journal for my poetic prose called <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/nUjk4AP21N6TB/" target="_blank">"Obsessive Diaries"</a>.</p>
